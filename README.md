#### Description:
It's a simple program for writing notes, intended for Windows systems. It allows for adding, editing, and deleting notes, keeping their content, category,
and creation date in a .csv file. Settings - for now those include only font size, font color, and background color - are similarly stored in a csv file.
While the program is written in Java, it makes use of the system tray, so it will not work properly on operating systems who lack that feature. 
The notes are displayed in orded by date created from the top. Editing notes does not change their creation date.
